# Weapon Detection with YOLOv5 and SAHI  

## Overview  

This project utilizes **YOLOv5** with **SAHI (Sliced Aided Hyper Inference)** to detect **weapons on humans**.  
SAHI enhances detection accuracy, especially for small objects like handguns and knives, by slicing images into smaller parts before inference.  

## Features  

- **Weapon Detection**: Identifies firearms, knives, and other weapons.  
- **Human Detection**: Detects humans alongside weapons.  
- **SAHI Integration**: Improves small object detection by slicing images.  
- **Post-Processing (Optional)**: Filters weapon detections based on proximity to humans.
